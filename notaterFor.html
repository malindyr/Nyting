    "if" statement: It is used for conditional execution.
     If a certain condition is true, a block of code is executed; 
     otherwise, it's skipped.

    "for" loop: It is used for repetitive tasks, 
    where you want to perform a specific action multiple times, 
    often based on an incrementing or decrementing counter.

    In summary, "for" is designed for iteration and repeating a block of code,
     while "if" is for making decisions based on conditions.*/
