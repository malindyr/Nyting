        /*In the first line (numbers[4] = 30;), you are assigning the value 30 to the element at index 4 in the array. 
        If the array is sparse (it doesn't have elements at indices 0 through 3), this will create empty slots in the array leading up to index 4. 
        In contrast, the push method adds the element to the end of the array, regardless of the current length or indices.

        If you are working with a scenario where you want to ensure that the element is added to the end of the array and avoid creating sparse arrays, 
        it's recommended to use push*/

/*Create an array:

Declare an array named numbers with the following elements: 5, 10, 15, 20.
Access and Modify:

Print the second element of the numbers array.
Change the value of the third element to 25.
Add and Remove:

Add the number 30 to the end of the array.
Remove the first element of the array.
Array Length:

Print the length of the numbers array.
Loop through the Array:

Use a for loop to iterate through each element of the array and print each element.*/
